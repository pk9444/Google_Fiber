# Google_Fiber 


This is the end-of-course project that was completed for the Google Business Intelligence Certificate Program. For this case study, the business scenario of an interview with Google Fiber was imagined, based on which, a completed Business Intelligence lifecycle is to be developed.

## BI Lifecycle 

The project was divided into three phases throughout the program: 

### Phase-1 : Project Planning 

In this phase, the project plan was rolled out and some essential documents were created from the meeting notes from the stakeholders.

1. Stakeholders Document

   - The core Business Problem was defined. 
   - Important stakeholders were identified.
   - How the BI tools and process will be used by end-users were planned.
      
2. Project Requirements Document

   - The stakeholder requirements and key dependencies were listed per the meeting notes. 
   - How will the success of the project be measured? For this, the S-M-A-R-T methodology was applied.
   - Some underlying assumptions were listed.
   - The User Experience, accessibility factors, and roll-out expectations were defined. 

3. Strategy Document
   
   - Based on the project requirements document, the strategy for building the BI tool or the ultimate dashboard design was imagined.
   - The Dashboard functionality was defined i.e. what all features that the dashboard must contain or would be "nice-to-have".
   - All the charts that would be included in the visualization were documented, along with dimensions and measures and how they address stakeholder needs.   

### Phase-2 : Data Preparation 

### Phase-3 : Dashboard Design
